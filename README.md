# Amethyst Apath

Amethyst Apath is a Minecraft server plugin that expands upon amethyst with end-game armor, tools & weapons.<br/>
It runs on any Spigot/Paper 1.21.10+ server. (to my knowledge, I haven't tested things yet.)

# Installation

Put the `jar` file inside of the `plugins` folder and put the datapack `amethystapathdatapack.zip` inside of your `world/datapacks` folder.

# Issues

Please note that I made this myself and I made it for a personal server, if you use this on your own server and experience issues, you can report them on the [Github issues page.](https://github.com/3RainbowCatz/amethyst-apath/issues)

# Build

I use Maven to compile.

```
mvn clean package
```

The jar file will be in `./target`
